I and three other folks - Aarti Ranganathan, Swaraj Mohapatra and Ambrose Wong worked together to come up with this interesting project. \r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nIn today's developed world everything is connected: people, information, events and places, and online social media has made it even easier. A practical way of making sense of the fuzzy connections is to analyze them as networks. With the help of Gephi, large amount of social network data is analyzed in an interactive way. The project demonstrates the hands-on analysis of real-world data sets and focuses on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation. The idea is to be able to extract information from a seemingly fuzzy network and recognize communities and cliques. We further used the same techniques and applied them on other networks such as word adjacencies, books about US politics, political blogs and Facebook data. \r\nUsing these datasets, we portrayed gender distribution in a Facebook network, commonly used adjectives in a book, conflicting trends in customer demands, and political dysfunction through blogs. These exploratory analysis was combined with unsupervised learning to detect communities in a Facebook dataset. These detection algorithms used clustering type algorithms where each node was selected into a certain group. However, this was a major drawback because people could belong to multiple communities. Hence linked community analysis was also performed where people could belong to multiple clusters.  \r\n\r\nFinally, with the help of ERGM, various models are built for Facebook data and the GWESP based model with degree 1 term is chosen based on MCMC diagnostics – which reveals the error distribution. Although the model has the second best AIC and BIC values, it is still chosen as its noise distribution is normal.\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\nWe analyzed four datasets in Gephi. The datasets differ from each other on various levels and the idea is to be able to extract information from seemingly fuzzy and different networks. The datasets include User Facebook data, word adjacencies, US political blogs and political books. In addition to Gephi, we also used R to analyze Facebook data. Note that the Facebook data was extracted using an API.\r\n\r\n### Facebook Network Analysis\r\nFacebook data from one of the users of the group was used for analysis.The attributes extracted from the facebook data include: \r\nNodes - The name of the people on the facebook user’s network\r\nId - Id is a variable that uniquely identifies the nodes on the network\r\nLabel - Label is an attribute that defines how a node is labelled on the network\r\nSex - Sex of the Facebook user’s friend\r\nAgerank - The user’s friends’s age rank. May be 13-17, 18-20 or 21+\r\nLocale - A two-letter language code and a two-letter country code representing the users’ friends’ locale\r\nDegree - The total number of edges connected to a node in the network\r\n\r\nThe network in the figure below shows that the user has quite a few communities and cliques in his Facebook network. Note that the nodes represent friends of the user and they are colored based on gender. With red nodes representing males and green nodes representing females. People who have not updated their sex on Facebook are represented as blue nodes. The links between the nodes indicate connections between the friends of the user and are called edges. In the above graph, the edges are undirected and each have the same weight. This implies that if you are my friend than I’m also your friend. \r\n![Fig 7.1](https://github.com/Inquisitive-Geek/Social-Network-Analysis/blob/master/Fig_7_1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe figure below shows a node which acts as a significant connection between the two groups of Facebook friends. This person plays a vital role and influences the common posts that the different user groups can find in their notifications. Studying this node further can help analyze the user behavior. \r\n![FB Network with important node highlighted](https://github.com/Inquisitive-Geek/Social-Network-Analysis/blob/master/Fig_7_2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nBased on the Facebook network, we can understand the distribution of the user’s friends. The people who play important roles in the network based on the number of mutual friends, friends who play the role of intermittent connections between different communities. This information affects the news feed of the user, information that will be accessible by the user and mutual friends’ suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Word Adjacencies\r\nWe explored the common adjectives and nouns in the novel \"David Copperfield\" by Charles Dickens and created an adjacency network. The attributes in the dataset include node and edge descriptions.\r\nThe node descriptions are as follows:\r\n* Nodes - The noun or adjective commonly used in the book\r\n* Id - Id is a variable that uniquely identifies the nodes on the network\r\n* Label - Label is the attribute which defines how the node is labelled on the network\r\n* Value - Indicates if the work is a noun or an adjective. 0: Adjective, 1: Noun\r\nThe edge descriptions are as follows:\r\n* Source - Indicates the node that acts as the source for the edge\r\n* Target - Indicates the node that acts as the target for the edge\r\n* Type - Specifies the type of the edge: Directed\r\n* Id - Id is a variable that uniquely identifies the edge on the network\t\r\n* Weight - The weight of an edge. In this dataset, each edge has an equal weight\r\nSince the dataset is directed, every node has an in-degree and an out-degree where in-degree is the number of words that have the current word as its predecessor and out-degree is the number of words that have the current word as its successor. The edge has a source and target indicating which node is the predecessor and which node is the successor for that connection. \r\n\r\nThe image on the left in the figure below indicates the distribution of the commonly used nouns and adjectives in the book. The nodes in red are adjectives and the nodes in blue are nouns. The image on the left gives more perspective as the size of the nodes depend on the in-degree and the out-degree. The nodes that is connected to many other nodes is indicated with a size bigger than the node that is less widely used. We can study these nodes further.\r\n![8.1.1](https://github.com/Inquisitive-Geek/Social-Network-Analysis/blob/master/Fig_8_1_1.png?raw=true)![Fig 8.1.2](https://github.com/Inquisitive-Geek/Social-Network-Analysis/blob/master/Fig_8_1_2.png?raw=true)","google":"UA-67244594-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
